# Optimizing-Agriculture-Production
A simple machine learning model which recommends best crop to grow depending on different climatic and soil conditions.

## MOTIVATION
Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a countryâ€™s economic growth.

In country like India, majority of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield.

In this project, I have created one predictive model which tells us the best crop to grow when user provides different climatic and soil conditions.
